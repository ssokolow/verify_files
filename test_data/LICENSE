good/testfile.nsis.exe was built using the Nullsoft Scriptable Install System
and includes code released under several permissive open-source licenses, none
of which impose attribution requirements on the generated binary.

See https://nsis-dev.github.io/NSIS-Forums/html/t-350646.html and
https://nsis.sourceforge.io/License for further details.

The self-extractor stubs on all self-extracting RAR archives included in this

The rest of the test files were created by me, Stephan Sokolow, and I believe
they are too simple to meet the criteria necessary to be eligible for
copyright in the first place.

However, to be certain, I hereby waive all copyright and related or
neighboring rights together with all associated claims and causes of action
with respect to this work to the extent possible under the law.
