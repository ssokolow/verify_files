With the exception of the ctime0.* files, all files in this test data set have
been released into the public domain.

---

The ctime0.* files in the good/ directory are unmodified copies of
test/files/ctime0.rar from the 969ba46d06e5aecd14cf2900883d594910881981
commit of markokr/rarfile on GitHub, originally retrieved from

https://github.com/markokr/rarfile/raw/969ba46d06e5aecd14cf2900883d594910881981/test/files/ctime0.rar

The ctime0.* files in the bad/ directory are the same file, which has been
modified in a hex editor by flipping a single bit, to cause CRC checks to fail.

The rest of the test files were created by me, Stephan Sokolow, and I believe
they are too simple to meet the criteria necessary to be eligible for
copyright in the first place.

However, to be certain, I hereby waive all copyright and related or
neighboring rights together with all associated claims and causes of action
with respect to this work to the extent possible under the law.
