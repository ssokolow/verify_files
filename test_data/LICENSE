All files in this test data set have been released into the public domain.

The following two images were released into the public domain by

The rest of the test files were created by me, Stephan Sokolow, and I believe
they are too simple to meet the criteria necessary to be eligible for
copyright in the first place.

However, to be certain, I hereby waive all copyright and related or
neighboring rights together with all associated claims and causes of action
with respect to this work to the extent possible under the law.
