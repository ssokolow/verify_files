1. All .rar and .cbr files in the `good` directory were created by
   Stephan Sokolow using a legitimate RAR/WinRAR license.
   See https://github.com/ssokolow/rar-test-files for details.

2. All .rar and .cbr files in the `bad` directory were created from their
   counterparts in the `good` directory by the `make_bad_files.py` script.

3. `good/testfile.lxz` was created by Stephan Sokolow using the freeware
   "Registered to the Amiga community for non-commercial use" release
   of LZX 1.21 EC (`LZX_Y2KF.LHA`) running inside inside FS-UAE with an
   Amiga 1200 Kickstart ROM purchased as part of Amiga Forever 2016
   Plus Edition.

4. `bad/testfile.lzx` was derived from `good/testfile.lzx` by running
   the `make_bad_files.py` script.

All other test files were created using legally free, open-source tools
installed from the Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS package repositories.

I hereby grant you permission to use any of these files for any purpose.
