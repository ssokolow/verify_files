/*! Application-specific logic lives here

    **TODO:** Look into moving the argument definition into a
    [build.rs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html) like in the
    [clap_generate](https://docs.rs/clap_generate/3.0.0-beta.1/clap_generate/fn.generate_to.html)
    examples so I don't have build the completion generation code into the output binary.

pub const DEFAULT_VERBOSITY: u64 = 1;

/// Command-line argument schema
///
/// ## Relevant Conventions:
///
///  * Make sure that there is a blank space between the `<name>` `<version>` line and the
///    description text or the `--help` output won't comply with the platform conventions that
///    `help2man` depends on to generate your manpage. (Specifically, it will mistake the `<name>
///    <version>` line for part of the description.)
///  * `StructOpt`'s default behaviour of including the author name in the `--help` output is an
///    oddity among Linux commands and, if you don't disable it, you run the risk of people
///    unfamiliar with `StructOpt` assuming that you are an egotistical person who made a conscious
///    choice to add it.
///
///    The proper standardized location for author information is the `AUTHOR` section which you
///    can read about by typing `man help2man`.
///
/// ## Cautions:
///  * Subcommands do not inherit `template` and it must be re-specified for each one.
///    ([clap-rs/clap#1184](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/1184))
///  * Double-check that your choice of `about` or `long_about` is actually overriding this
///    doc comment. The precedence has some bugs such as
///    [TeXitoi/structopt#391](https://github.com/TeXitoi/structopt/issues/391) and
///    [TeXitoi/structopt#333](https://github.com/TeXitoi/structopt/issues/333).
///  * Do not begin the description text for subcommands with `\n`. It will break the formatting in
///    the top-level help output's list of subcommands.
